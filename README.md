About
I'm a third-year engineering student specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. I learn best by building: I pick a real problem, get a rough version working end to end, and then improve it until I understand why it works and where it breaks.
Most of my projects sit where machine learning meets something practical: spotting scam calls, estimating hospital readmission risk, and locating patterns in noisy semiconductor images. I enjoy the unglamorous parts too, like writing tests, documenting limitations, and being honest about what a result does and doesn't show.
Right now I'm using hackathons and team projects to sharpen my Python, ML and full-stack skills, practicing data structures and algorithms regularly, and preparing for internships. I'm open to collaborating on projects where AI is applied to a real problem.

Featured Projects
TrustCall AI
A call-risk scorer that weighs what is said together with how it sounds. Built for the TechSprint hackathon (team of three), where I worked on the ML and signal-processing side.
Voice-cloning and impersonation scams slip past caller-ID checks, so TrustCall AI scores the call content itself and returns a 0–100 trust score with plain-language reasons.
Scam-language scoring: rule patterns plus a TF-IDF and logistic-regression classifier (scikit-learn) that flag urgency, threats, credential requests and similar tactics, including Hinglish phrases.
Audio anomaly scoring: Librosa-based pitch-jitter and spectral-flatness checks on the voice signal.
Fusion and delivery: the two scores combine into a risk band with suggested actions, served by a FastAPI `/analyze` endpoint and a React + Vite + Tailwind dashboard.
Honest scope: a hackathon prototype. The audio side is signal-processing heuristics, not a trained deepfake detector; voice-embedding verification and mobile integration are roadmap ideas, not built.

ReAdmitIQ  ·  live frontend
Clinical decision support for 30-day hospital readmission risk. A team project (four of us); I built the backend.
Hospitals need to decide who gets follow-up resources after discharge. ReAdmitIQ presents readmission risk with explanations, so a clinician can see what is driving a score rather than just a number.
Backend (my part): versioned FastAPI REST API, JWT/OAuth2 authentication with role-based access, SQLAlchemy models, audit logging, demo-data seeding and PDF report generation.
ML pipeline: model comparison, probability calibration and SHAP explanations in the `ml/` folder, with pipeline tests.
Frontend: React 18 + Vite + Tailwind + Recharts, with separate views for doctors, administrators and patients; the frontend is deployed to GitHub Pages.
Scope: decision support only. It is not a diagnostic tool and doesn't replace clinical judgment.

Drift-Sense
Locating a pattern inside a noisy, drifted semiconductor (SEM) image. Built for the SEMI i4C Ideathon 2026 Applied Materials challenge.
When a microscope's field of view drifts, the target pattern has to be found again in a wide, noisy capture. Drift-Sense is a classical computer-vision pipeline for that, plus the synthetic data needed to test it.
Synthetic SEM data: a generator for DRAM and FinFET layouts with noise, blur, charging and scan-line artifacts.
Multi-stage localization: FFT phase correlation, template matching, ORB + RANSAC verification, score fusion and sub-pixel refinement (OpenCV, NumPy, scikit-image).
Evaluation and tests: a 30-case benchmark harness, baseline comparison and unit tests.
Honest results: on synthetic data the hit rate is about 80% for DRAM but only 13% for FinFET, where repeating structures create ambiguity. The repo's self-audit documents this, along with a confidence score that turned out not to predict correctness.

LeetCode practice
Steady problem-solving practice in Java, synced from LeetCode with LeetHub. About 20 solved problems so far, mostly stack-based bracket-matching, dynamic programming, string and array problems, each with its own README.

Let's Connect
I'm looking for internships and team projects where I can build something useful with AI and learn from people further along. If you're working on something in applied ML, computer vision or healthcare and safety tech, I'd like to hear about it.
LinkedIn: parth-patil-a01a80326
GitHub: you're here. Opening an issue or a discussion on any repo works too.
